# Stop-Using-Else Official SocialNerds Challenge

## Intro

"Stop-Using-Else Official SocialNerds Challenge", SUEOSNC in short, is the
new hot thing in programming.

You are all invited to take this hot mess of a code, of an actual production
method (not any more of course), and remove the "else" word completely.
Provided that it still works.

## How to

- Clone/Fork the project
- Rewrite getAccess() method from the Initial.php file to the Corrected.php 
file, without "else"
- Make a pull request

## Results

We will publish on 03/04 a video with our take on it. 

In true democratic spirit, If someone else makes a pull request with
better code than ours, we will make theirs the actual corrected method.

## Not-so-hot-tips

Something that is obvious in getAccess() method  after a while, is that it
does two things. It retrieves access and it caches it. Maybe, it would be
better if the method was broken in two methods. Just sayin'

## Disclaimer

- This method is taken exactly as it was
- We know that anyone, who has not actually worked on the project, has very
little context of what is going on. So, we will not act like b1tch#s if a pull
request is not exactly as it should be
- We should provide a unit test. We know... Next time, we will!
